### page information
this is a classic screamer site, which shows an information about cookie files on the supposed "Lightshot" website. by pressing `ACCEPT`, the jumpscare will appear and when `DECLINE` is pressed, nothing special will happen.

### installation/usage
since I can't host the website at the moment, here are the steps you can follow to enjoy congregating someone:
1. in this page press the green `CODE` button and select `Download ZIP`
2. extract the downloaded folder from the zip file to some directory of your choice
3. go to that directory and activate the HTML script `index.html`
4. enjoy congregating!

# original README

A copy of pnrtscr.com was created to prank users in chatrooms. I have rewritten the source code to revive the now-defunct pnrtscr.com.
Of course, I do not take credit; the real creators of the site deserve the recognition from which I drew inspiration.
P.S. Please do not take the source code and modify it to remove the warning, as it can be very dangerous for those who suffer from epileptic seizures.
